# HomeWidget

My approach on a Widget for  IOS. I tried to keep it simple but add also add many usefull features. You are able to see the weekday and the date, your next three events in your apple calendar and your upcoming reminder. Moreover, it shows the current weather with the highs and lows of the day and the percantage of precipitation. It also shows you the weather forecast for the next five hours.
However I also tried to keep you space for some customizations for example a easy way to add your own backgroundimage or your prefered font and fontcolor.

The weathericons are not my own creation. I used icons from https://www.iconfinder.com/.
